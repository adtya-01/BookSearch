## How long did you spend on the coding assignment?

I spend around 8 hours on this coding assignment.

## What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

 If I had more time, I would add a feature that allows users to filter their search results based on the book's genre or publication date. This would make it easier for users to find the exact book they are looking for. Additionally, I would improve the styling of the website to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly (Material UI / Tailwind)

## What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
 
 One useful feature in this code is the useEffect hook that adds and removes an event listener when the component mounts and unmounts respectively. Here's the code snippet for that:
 
## How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

To track down a performance issue in production, I would use a combination of profiling tools and log analysis. First, I would use a tool like Chrome DevTools to profile the performance of my application and identify any slow or expensive functions. I would then analyze the server logs to see if there are any bottlenecks or errors that could be causing the performance issue. If necessary, I would use a tool like New Relic to monitor the performance of my application in real-time and alert me to any issues.

## How would you improve the API that you just used?

To improve the API that I just used, I would add support for pagination and caching. Pagination would allow users to retrieve a subset of the search results at a time, making it faster and more efficient to retrieve large datasets. Caching would allow frequently requested data to be stored in memory or on disk, reducing the number of requests made to the Google Books API and improving the overall performance of the application.
