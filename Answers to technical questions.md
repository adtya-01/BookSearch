1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?

I spend around 8 hours on this coding assignment.

a. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

 If I had more time, I would add a feature that allows users to filter their search results based on the book's genre or publication date. This would make it easier for users to find the exact book they are looking for. Additionally, I would improve the styling of the website to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen


language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you&#39;ve used it.
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
